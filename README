This is the Qxw crossword creation software from:  http://www.quinapalus.com/qxw.html

The Makefile has been edited to get it working with snowleopard on mac, after following
the suggestions from the Qxw site:

1. If not installed already, use Darwin Ports to install gtk2 (do not use jhbuild or similar):

    sudo port install gtk2

2. If there are issues, remove outdated libraries with

    sudo port uninstall outdated

and update all packages using

    sudo port upgrade installed

following any command line instructions to link libs to the right place, and then try installing gtk2.

3. Make sure that pkgconfig is installed with

    sudo port install pkgconfig
